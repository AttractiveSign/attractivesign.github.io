## Tech Stack

This project is built with simplicity and performance in mind, following a "no-framework" approach to master the fundamentals:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for better SEO and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling with a focus on responsive design and modern layouts (Flexbox/Grid).
* **GitHub Pages:** Automated deployment and hosting.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a main landing page and detailed project-specific pages for deep dives:

* `index.html`: The main "one-pager" including my Bio, Tech Stack, and Project Overview.
* `style.css`: Centralized stylesheet using CSS Variables for easy theming.
* `project-*.html`: Detailed pages for individual projects (e.g., Home Server, Linux setup).

## Key Features

- **Mobile Responsive:** Fully optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile phones to ultrawide monitors.
- **Project Deep Dives:** Dedicated sub-pages for complex projects to provide technical details, code snippets, and challenges.
- **Tech-Oriented Design:** Minimalist "Dark Mode" aesthetic, reflecting my passion for Linux and server environments.
